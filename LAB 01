1. Design an inheritance hierarchy with at least five classes arranged in at least three levels of inheritance.

Since my topic is Ninja Village, I have decided to go with the theme of Narutoâ€”a popular anime about ninjas. In the show, there are ninjas with specific ranks.
As they learn and work, their rank and role as a ninja change. I will utilize this to create an inheritance hierarchy.

Ninja - base class -> this class should be changed to abstract (but theoreticaly this lab is before the lab where we will learn to use it propely so it is not)
  It has 4 properties:
    Name -> string - Name of the ninja
      Protected - for easier later usedge in methods in inharited classes
    Health -> int - Value of the health
      Private - I want to use seter and gether to control the health values while using methods
    ChakraLevel -> int - Value of the Chakra Level
      Private - I want to use seter and gether to control the chakra level while using methods
  Three methods:
    Train: Uses Chakra and incrises base atack of ninja /diff- (in future for diffrent ranks diffret effects of training)
    Attack:
    Meditate:
