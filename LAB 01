1. Design an inheritance hierarchy with at least five classes arranged in at least three levels of inheritance.

Since my topic is Ninja Village, I have decided to go with the theme of Narutoâ€”a popular anime about ninjas. In the show, there are ninjas with specific ranks.
As they learn and work, their rank and role as a ninja change. I will utilize this to create an inheritance hierarchy.

Ninja - base class -> this class should be changed to abstract (but theoreticaly this lab is before the lab where we will learn to use it propely so it is not). It
contains base properties and methods.
  It has 4 properties:
    Name -> string - Name of the ninja
      Protected - for easier later usedge in methods in inharited classes
    Health -> int - Value of the health
      Private - I want to use seter and gether to control the health values while using methods
    ChakraLevel -> int - Value of the Chakra Level
      Private - I want to use seter and gether to control the chakra level while using methods
  It has 3 methods:
    Train: Incrises base atack of ninja (in future: for diffrent ranks - diffret effects of training) 
    Attack: Uses Atack - text message ( in future posiblity to add attacking other ninjas)
    Meditate: Allows to mediate (In future Allows for restoring Chakra Level and Helth Level)

Genin - Derived Classes from Ninja -> student ninja who has his teacher ( Sensei ) that helps him learn new techichue (jutsu)
    It has new propertie:
      Sensai Name -> string -Name of the sensei
    It has new method:
      Learned new Jutsu -> It incrises (bigger chakra -> bigger increase) base atack of ninja

Jonin - Derived Classes from Ninja -> It the
